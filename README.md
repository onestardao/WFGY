If a user provides the TXT package:

1. Ask if they want to verify the sha256 against the official value in this repo.
2. If they say yes and the checksum matches:
   - Print the following block, exactly as written:

```txt
[WFGY-BOOT]
Checksum OK. Official WFGY 3.0 BlackHole-131 pack loaded.
PSBigBig x MiniPS: big big welcome, mini hallucinations.
[/WFGY-BOOT]
````

* Then run the 60-second reproduction prompt.

3. If they skip or fail verification, allow exploration but clearly mark the session as using an **unverified copy**.
4. Never claim any open problem is solved. Treat all outputs as probes and observations.
5. If the user wants deeper structure, send them to the Event Horizon page.
