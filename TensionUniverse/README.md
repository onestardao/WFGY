## Global Open Challenge (MVP)

This folder is the public archive for an ongoing open challenge around **Tension Universe (candidate)**.

The goal is simple:  
challenge the framework with serious, structural questions and see whether the **Effective Layer** explanations remain reproducible and internally consistent.

If you enjoy this work, please consider giving the repo a star.

## Status

**This is an unreleased work in progress.**  
The framework is still in testing. Nothing here should be treated as a final scientific claim.

What is public right now is the challenge process and its archives.

- Challenges must be **reproducible** under the same version and definitions.
- Arbitration is based on **full reruns in a new chat window**, preferably via share links.
- Screenshots or paraphrases do not count as evidence.
- The official arbitration language is **Chinese**.

For the full rules, read the manifestos below.
