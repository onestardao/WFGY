# Tension Universe (candidate)

## Status: Internal Testing

Tension Universe (TU) is currently in an internal testing phase.

What is public at this stage is intentionally limited:
only the Effective Layer language, the public archives, and the rerun friendly process.
This is not a final scientific claim and not a full release of foundations.

If you want the longer narrative, scope boundaries, and the public challenge documents, read:
[Overview_LongForm.md](./Overview_LongForm.md)

## What you can do here (MVP)

If you are skeptical about scaling only progress, or you care about structural consistency, you can:

- challenge the Effective Layer with serious questions
- rerun the same question under the same definitions and compare stability
- check whether the responses remain coherent across independent reruns

This repository aims to stay reproducible and testable at the surface level.

## Response archives (public record)

Accepted challenges and responses are archived here:

- [challenge_responses/](./challenge_responses/)

Each entry is stored as a permalink style record for future reference.

## Notes

- This archive focuses on the Effective Layer only.
- Requests to extract unreleased axioms, internal construction rules, or implementation details may be refused.
- Safety boundary questions (weapons, illegal instructions, harm) will be declined and do not count as challenge wins.
- Openness of future releases is intentionally undecided at this stage.
