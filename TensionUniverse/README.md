## Status: Internal Testing Phase

**Tension Universe (TU)** is currently in an internal testing phase.

What is public at this stage is **only the effective-layer language and the challenge process**.
This repository is not a full release of the theory, nor a disclosure of its underlying axioms or construction rules.

The purpose of this stage is limited and explicit:
to pressure-test whether the effective-layer explanations remain
**internally consistent, reproducible, and structurally coherent**
when challenged with serious questions.

## Global Open Challenge (MVP)

This folder serves as the public archive for an ongoing open challenge around **Tension Universe (candidate)**.

The goal is simple:

Challenge the framework with structural questions and observe whether the **Effective Layer**
remains stable under independent verification and reruns.

This is a testing ground, not a finished scientific claim.

If you find the challenge process valuable, you are welcome to star the repository.

## How the challenge works (short version)

- Challenges must be **reproducible** under the same version and definitions.
- Arbitration is based on **full reruns in a new chat window**, preferably via share links.
- Screenshots or paraphrases do not count as evidence.
- The official arbitration language is **Chinese**.

For the complete rules, see the manifestos below.

- The scope and openness of future releases are intentionally undecided at this stage.
