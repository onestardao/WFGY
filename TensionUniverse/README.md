# Tension Universe (candidate)

![08a638cc-4d7f-413e-8ef6-1c18ec0d5d80](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/779bae6b-7438-4d6a-95b9-ed5c92cad634)

## Status: Internal testing

Tension Universe (TU) is currently in an internal testing phase.

What is public at this stage is intentionally limited.  
Only the Effective Layer language, the public archives, and rerun friendly processes are exposed.  
This is not a final scientific claim and not a full release of the underlying foundations.

For a longer narrative and scope boundaries, see:

- [Overview_LongForm.md](./Overview_LongForm.md)

## Directory map · where to go first

Most of the structure is in the folders you see in this directory.  
A quick map:

- **EventHorizon/**  
  Main entry for WFGY 3.0. Contains the Singularity demo, TXT package instructions, and
  high level navigation for people who just want to try the system and see concrete behavior.  
  - [EventHorizon/README.md](./EventHorizon/README.md)

- **BlackHole/**  
  The S-problem collection. Each file is a century-level problem re-encoded in TU language
  with an Effective Layer focus and a strict footer.  
  This is where Q001–Q131 live.  
  - [BlackHole/](./BlackHole/)

- **Charters/**  
  Formal documents that define how TU is allowed to talk.  
  This includes the Effective Layer charter, Encoding and Fairness charter, Tension Scale charter,
  and global guardrails.  
  - [Charters/](./Charters/)

- **Experiments/**  
  Reproducible experiments written at the Effective Layer.  
  This is where the Q130 MVP scripts and future TU experiments are collected.  
  - [Experiments/README.md](./Experiments/README.md)

- **challenge_responses/**  
  Public archive of accepted challenges and written responses, stored as permalink style records.  
  - [challenge_responses/](./challenge_responses/)

Other top-level files, such as the challenge manifestos and external verification notes, explain
how public challenges are supposed to be run and recorded.

## What you can do here (MVP)

If you are skeptical about pure scaling progress, or you care about structural consistency, you can:

- read the charters and check whether the Effective Layer behaves as promised  
- pick a BlackHole S-problem and challenge the encoding  
- rerun the same question under the same definitions and compare stability  
- run the Experiments notebooks with your own OpenAI API key and look for the same qualitative patterns  
- submit challenges that will be answered and archived in `challenge_responses/`

The goal is to keep this repository reproducible and testable at the surface level, without
requiring access to any unreleased internal machinery.

---

## Response archives (public record)

Accepted challenges and responses are archived here:

- [challenge_responses/](./challenge_responses/)

Each entry is stored as a stable record for future reference and external auditing.

---

## Main arena (Discord)

For higher frequency challenges, live discussions, and informal follow ups, join the Discord:

https://discord.gg/wvueqkFsp7

The GitHub repo is the canonical record. Discord is where most day-to-day interaction happens.

## Notes

- This archive focuses on the Effective Layer only.  
- Requests to extract unreleased axioms, internal construction rules, or implementation details
  may be refused.  
- Safety boundary questions (weapons, illegal instructions, harm) will be declined and do not
  count as challenge wins.  
- Openness of future releases is intentionally undecided at this stage.  
- Everything exposed here is meant to be rerun, inspected, and challenged under the same
  definitions so that any failure can be recorded and studied.
