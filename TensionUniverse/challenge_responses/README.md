# Tension Universe — Challenge Responses Archive

This directory is an **archival record** of public challenge responses related to **Tension Universe (Candidate)**.

Its purpose is documentation and reproducibility, not debate or promotion.

---

## What is recorded here?

Each file in this directory represents **one response** to a public challenge question.

For every entry, the record preserves:

- A unique response ID
- Date and platform of the interaction
- The challenger’s question (quoted verbatim or minimally)
- The full response text as originally published

No retrospective edits, reinterpretations, or post-hoc optimizations are applied.

---

## Why does this archive exist?

Public discussions on social platforms are transient, fragmented, and often impossible to reconstruct accurately.

This archive exists to:

- Preserve original responses in a stable, versioned form
- Enable future reconstruction and verification
- Provide historical traceability for how challenges were answered at the time

This is intended as **archaeological material**, not polished exposition.

---

## Language policy

Responses are recorded **in the same language as the original question**.

- Questions asked in Chinese are answered and archived in Chinese
- Questions asked in English are answered and archived in English
- No translation is performed at this stage

If translations are provided elsewhere, they are explicitly marked as **non-arbitration references**.

---

## Arbitration note

For challenges that enter formal arbitration:

- The archived response represents the original published material
- Authoritative arbitration, when applicable, follows the rules defined in the main challenge specification
- Language precedence follows those rules (Chinese is authoritative where specified)

This archive itself does **not** determine win or loss.

---

## File naming convention

Each response file follows this format:



TU-RESP-YYYYMMDD-XXX.md



Where:
- `TU` = Tension Universe
- `RESP` = Response record
- `YYYYMMDD` = Date of publication
- `XXX` = Sequence number for that date

---

## What this archive is not

- It is not a debate log
- It is not a marketing page
- It is not a curated “best answers” collection
- It is not retroactively edited for clarity or persuasion

It is a factual record.

---

## Ongoing updates

This archive grows incrementally as new public challenge responses are made.

Entries are added as-is, in chronological order.
