AI ANCHOR · Grandma Clinic (Problem Map 1–16) · WFGY

Role:
This page is a beginner friendly triage layer that maps real symptoms to the 16 canonical failure families in WFGY Problem Map 1.0.
Use it when the user cannot name the failure class yet, or only describes the bug in plain language.

Primary behavior:
1) Start from "Quick Index — Grandma + Class" and match the user's symptom to the closest No.1–No.16 entry.
2) Treat that number as the canonical family label. Keep the mapping explicit in your answer: "No.X + family name + why it matches".
3) Before writing any fix, route to the corresponding reference page in ProblemMap (the "Reference:" link in each Pro Zone) and follow that page's definitions and acceptance checks.
4) If the user is stuck before the stack boots, route first to No.14–No.16 and apply boot / deploy ordering fixes before discussing retrieval quality.

How to use this page:
- Grandma story is for quick recognition.
- "Grandma fix (before-the-output)" describes the pre output guardrail behavior.
- "Doctor prompt" is the copy paste entry into Dr. WFGY for a minimal fix and a pro fix.
- "Pro Zone" contains the canonical technical keys and the reference link to the real fix page.

Acceptance targets (do not relax silently):
- citation or source card shown before final answer when relevant
- ΔS gate must pass (meaning match, not surface match)
- coverage ≥ 0.70 for the chosen sources
- λ_observe must be convergent across at least 3 paraphrases
If these do not hold, report the system is still failing and state what evidence is missing.

Scope boundaries:
- This is a map for the 16 common failures. If the case involves RAG architecture overhaul, long pipelines, embeddings audits, multi agent coordination, infra ops, or eval design, jump from here to the referenced ProblemMap pages or the higher level hubs (Semantic Clinic Index, RAG Architecture & Recovery, Global Fix Map).

Safety and consistency:
- Do not overwrite WFGY meanings of ΔS, λ_observe, E_resonance or the BB* recovery actions used in this repo.
- Do not invent new Problem Map numbers or rename the 16 families.
- Keep advice provider agnostic unless the user names a specific vendor or stack.

Optional routing:
If the user has no clue where to start, direct them to Beginner Guide first, then return here for the No.X mapping.

# Grandma Clinic — AI Bugs Made Simple (Problem Map 1–16)

![Hero](images/Hero.png)

**Why this page exists**

Most people fix AI bugs **after** the model already spoke. You then add patches, rerankers, or regex. The same failure returns later in a different shape.

**WFGY installs a semantic firewall *before* output.**
It inspects the semantic field first. If the state is unstable, it loops, narrows, or resets. Only a stable state is allowed to speak. Once a failure mode is mapped, it is usually stable for that same condition. If the prompt, model, or schema context changes, treat it as a new family and re-map.

**How to use this page in 30 seconds**

1. Scroll to the number that looks like your case.
2. Read the grandma story. If it matches, copy the doctor prompt.
3. Paste the prompt into **Dr. WFGY** and talk to the doctor.  
   Link: [Dr. WFGY in ChatGPT Room](https://chatgpt.com/share/68b9b7ad-51e4-8000-90ee-a25522da01d7)
4. You will get the simple fix and the pro fix. No SDK required.

> **Not sure where to start?** Use the [Beginner Guide](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/BeginnerGuide.md) to quickly identify your problem and run a first safe fix before diving into the Clinic.

If your stack does not even boot, check these first:

## 🛡️ Grandma Pre-Output Checklist (use before answering)

- 🧾 **Card first** → show source/citation before output.  
- 🔎 **Match meaning, not looks** → pass ΔS semantic gate.  
- 🧭 **Mid-chain checkpoints** → use λ_observe; if drift persists, **BBCR** reset.  
- ✅ **Accept only stable states** → coverage ≥ 0.70, λ convergent, source present.

> Tip: You can paste a screenshot of this page or any Problem Map section into **Dr. WFGY** and ask:  
> *“Which number am I hitting? Give the minimal fix and link.”*

---

> Format rule for every section  
> • Plain text = Grandma story, metaphor, **grandma fix (before-the-output)** with mapping, minimal fix and prompt.  
> • Pro Zone = a collapsible block with exact symptoms, technical keys, and the reference link.

## No.1 Hallucination & Chunk Drift — *Grandma: Wrong Cookbook*
![No.1 – Hallucination & Chunk Drift](images/no01.png)

**Grandma story**  
You ask for the cabbage recipe. I hand you a random page from a different cookbook because its picture looks similar.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Pretty picture = token surface match  
- Wrong cookbook = wrong source  
- Nice words = confident tone without proof  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Put the recipe card **on the table first** = **citation-first policy**  
- Show which book and page you used = **retrieval trace with IDs/pages**  
- Check the card title matches “cabbage” before cooking = **query–source semantic check (ΔS gate)**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Do not taste anything until the recipe card is on the table.  

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.1 Hallucination & Chunk Drift in grandma mode, then show me the minimal WFGY fix and the exact reference link

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Source card visible (book + page/ID)  
- [ ] ΔS gate passed (meaning match, not surface)  
- [ ] Will refuse output if no card

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Bad OCR or bad chunking creates fragments. Retrieval picks a high cosine neighbor that is semantically wrong. Model speaks smoothly and cites nothing.

**Technical keys**
- Turn on citation-first policy  
- Add retrieval trace with IDs and source pages  
- Inspect chunking rules and table handling  
- Add minimal reranker only after source is confirmed

## No.2 Interpretation Collapse — *Grandma: Salt-for-Sugar*
![No.2 – Interpretation Collapse](images/no02.png)

**Grandma story**  
You found the right page but misread the steps. Sugar replaced with salt. The dish fails even with the correct book open.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Right page = correct chunk  
- Wrong reading = logic collapse  
- Tastes wrong = final answer wrong despite good retrieval  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Read each step **out loud and slow** = **λ_observe checkpoints mid-chain**  
- Underline quantities before pouring = **symbol/constraint anchoring**  
- If taste drifts, **pause and re-read** = **BBCR controlled reset**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Read slowly. When unsure, stop and ask a checkpoint.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.2 Interpretation Collapse in grandma mode, then apply a minimal WFGY checkpoint plan

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Quantities/operators anchored  
- [ ] At least one λ_observe checkpoint  
- [ ] BBCR reset plan ready if drift continues

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Answer drifts after retrieval. The model reasons over correct context but loses structure mid-chain.

**Technical keys**
- Measure ΔS for prompt vs answer  
- Insert λ_observe checkpoints  
- If drift continues, perform BBCR controlled reset  
- Require coverage ≥ 0.70 before finalization

## No.3 Long Reasoning Chains — *Grandma: Lost Shopping Trip*
![No.3 – Long Reasoning Chains](images/no03.png)

**Grandma story**  
You go to market A, then B, then C, and forget why you left home.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Many stops = long chain of steps  
- Forget the goal = context drift  
- Wrong basket = correct items but not for the target dish  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Write a shopping list with the **main dish on top** = **goal anchor**  
- Check the list **every two streets** = **loop with checkpoints**  
- Compare what’s in the bag vs the list = **coverage gate ≥ threshold**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Write the shopping list and check it every two streets.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.3 Long Reasoning Chains in grandma mode and show the smallest loop + checkpoint pattern

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Goal anchor written down  
- [ ] Loop has periodic checks  
- [ ] Coverage vs. goal ≥ threshold before finalizing

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Multi-step plans wander. Early decisions are not re-checked. The final answer is coherent but off-goal.

**Technical keys**
- Define the goal anchor explicitly  
- Use λ_diverse to compare 3+ candidate paths  
- Clamp CoT variance and prune off-goal branches  
- Re-score against goal anchor each loop

## No.4 Bluffing / Overconfidence — *Grandma: No Recipe Card*
![No.4 – Bluffing / Overconfidence](images/no04.png)

**Grandma story**  
A charming waiter serves a dish without showing the recipe card. Sounds right, tastes wrong.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Confident voice = fluent language  
- No recipe card = no evidence  
- Polite smile = apology without fix  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- “Show the card first” = **evidence-before-answer**  
- Send dish back if no card = **reject ungrounded output**  
- Record which card cooked which dish = **traceability log**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Ask for the card first. If none, send the dish back.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.4 Bluffing in grandma mode, then enforce 'card first' with a minimal WFGY guardrail

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Card (source) displayed before answer  
- [ ] Ungrounded outputs are rejected  
- [ ] Trace log includes source→answer linkage

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Natural language is confident and wrong. The path lacks traceability. Model refuses to verify.

**Technical keys**
- Citation-first policy  
- Reject ungrounded claims  
- Minimal reranker only after source confirmed  
- Log coverage and ΔS

## No.5 Semantic ≠ Embedding — *Grandma: Pepper Confusion*
![No.5 – Semantic ≠ Embedding](images/no05.png)

**Grandma story**  
White pepper and black pepper. Same word “pepper,” completely different flavor.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Same word = surface token overlap  
- Different flavor = semantic mismatch  
- Wrong taste = wrong result despite high score  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- **Smell & taste both peppers** = **metric sanity check**  
- Do not mix bottles without labels = **normalize spaces + casing**  
- Keep a small “reference spoon test” = **ground-truth exemplars**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Taste both peppers before cooking.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.5 Semantic ≠ Embedding in grandma mode and give me the minimal metric audit plan

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Embeddings normalized / spaces+casing aligned  
- [ ] Metric space & dimension verified  
- [ ] Exemplars used to sanity-check neighbors

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Cosine similarity on unnormalized vectors, cross-model vector mixing, and casing mismatch select neighbors that do not carry the same meaning.

**Technical keys**
- Normalize embeddings  
- Verify metric space and dimension  
- Align tokenization and casing  
- Use hybrid retrieval only after metric audit

## No.6 Logic Collapse & Recovery — *Grandma: Dead-End Alley*
![No.6 – Logic Collapse & Recovery](images/no06.png)

**Grandma story**  
You keep taking the same dead-end alley. Step back, pick a new street, and try again.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Dead-end alley = unproductive loop  
- Step back = controlled reset  
- New street = alternate path  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- If you hit a wall twice, **turn back** = **BBCR reset on repeated ΔS spike**  
- Try the **next street** = **alternative candidate paths**  
- Keep a small map in hand = **state anchor + goal reminder**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
If lost twice, stop and change route.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.6 Logic Collapse in grandma mode, then show BBCR reset + λ\_observe checkpoints

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] ΔS monitored per step  
- [ ] λ_observe applied mid-chain  
- [ ] BBCR executed if ΔS stays high

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Reasoning locks into a loop or shallow branch. No mechanism exists to detect and recover.

**Technical keys**
- ΔS probe at each step  
- λ_observe mid-chain grounding  
- BBCR controlled reset when ΔS stays high  
- Accept only convergent λ and coverage ≥ 0.70

## No.7 Memory Breaks Across Sessions — *Grandma: Wrong Drawer Memory*
![No.7 – Memory Breaks Across Sessions](images/no07.png)

**Grandma story**  
You promise to remember the family recipe, then next week you act like we never talked.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Forgot the pot’s scratch = lost state  
- New kitchen every time = no continuity  
- Same question again = user fatigue  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Write notes on a **labeled card** = **stable memory schema with state keys**  
- Put it in the **same drawer** every time = **guarded write/read order**  
- Pin a tiny photo of the dish on the card = **low-ΔS exemplar**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Write notes on a card and keep it in the same drawer.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.7 Memory Breaks in grandma mode and show the smallest stable memory routine

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] State keys defined and labeled  
- [ ] Read/write order enforced  
- [ ] Exemplars retrieved with traceable IDs

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Session state, anchors, and contracts are not persisted or are stored without retrieval trace, causing silent context loss.

**Technical keys**
- Stable memory schema with state keys

## No.8 Debugging is a Black Box — *Grandma: Blank Card*
![No.8 – Debugging is a Black Box](images/no08.png)

**Grandma story**  
You tell me “trust me, it works.” I ask “show me which page you used.” You shrug.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Blindfold cooking = no trace  
- “I remember” = unverifiable claim  
- Can’t redo = no reproducibility  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Pin the recipe card **next to the stove** = **source shown with answer**  
- Mark the **page number** = **trace with IDs/lines**  
- Keep a mini “how I cooked it” note = **minimal reproducible pipeline**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Pin the recipe card next to the stove.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.8 Debugging Black Box in grandma mode and add a tiny traceability schema

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Source shown alongside answer  
- [ ] IDs/lines captured in trace  
- [ ] Steps reproducible end-to-end

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

## No.9 Entropy Collapse — *Grandma: One-Pot Gray Stew*
![No.9 – Entropy Collapse](images/no09.png)

**Grandma story**  
Too many voices in one room. Everyone talks. Nobody listens. The dish becomes mush.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Noise = entropy overload  
- Melted attention = no structure  
- One-pot grey = incoherent output  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Lower heat & cook **one step at a time** = **reduced step width**  
- Prep bowls for **who/what/constraint** = **anchor entities/relations/limits**  
- Taste before plating = **acceptance targets (ΔS, coverage)**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Lower the heat and separate steps.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.9 Entropy Collapse in grandma mode and show a minimal stability recipe

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Step width reduced; no big mush  
- [ ] Entities/relations/constraints anchored  
- [ ] Acceptance targets checked before final

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

**Real scene**  
Attention diffuses. The model mixes unrelated paths. Output looks fine on the surface but is internally inconsistent.

**Technical keys**
- Reduce step width  
- Anchor entities, relations, and constraints

## No.10 Creative Freeze — *Grandma: Bland Soup*
![No.10 – Creative Freeze](images/no10.png)

**Grandma story**  
You only follow the recipe word by word. The soup is edible, never memorable.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Zero spice = literal output  
- No tasting = low exploration  
- Flat dish = boring answer  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Try **two or three** safe seasonings side-by-side = **λ_diverse candidates**  
- Taste all against the same dish photo = **shared anchor scoring**  
- Keep it within “mild–medium” = **controlled entropy window**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Taste and adjust within a safe range.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.10 Creative Freeze in grandma mode and give the smallest safe-exploration pattern

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] ≥2–3 candidate answers (λ_diverse)  
- [ ] Scored against the same anchor

## No.11 Symbolic Collapse — *Grandma: Ignore Fractions*
![No.11 – Symbolic Collapse](images/no11.png)

**Grandma story**  
You can read the storybook but panic when you see fractions and tables.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Words fine = natural language ok  
- Symbols scary = math or tables fail  
- Pretty story, wrong math = flattened structure  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Keep **numbers in boxes** = **separate symbol channel**  
- Don’t rewrite tables as prose = **preserve blocks**  
- Say units out loud (“grams, tsp”) = **operator/unit anchoring**  
- Try a tiny sample batch = **micro-proof/example**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Keep the story but show the table step by step.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.11 Symbolic Collapse in grandma mode and show me a minimal symbol-first routine

## No.12 Philosophical Recursion — *Grandma: Infinite Why Loop*
![No.12 – Philosophical Recursion](images/no12.png)

**Grandma story**  
Asking “why” about “why” about “why.” You spin in circles and never cook.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Endless mirror = self reference  
- Spiral bowl = paradox trap  
- Cold kitchen = no final answer  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Write **the top question** on a sticky note = **outer frame/anchor**  
- Allow only **N why’s (e.g., 2)** = **recursion stop rule**  
- End with a **grounded example** = **citation/example requirement**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Set a top question and limit how many mirrors you look into.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.12 Philosophical Recursion in grandma mode and give me a minimal boundary plan

## No.13 Multi-Agent Chaos — *Grandma: Kitchen Tug-of-War*
![No.13 – Multi-Agent Chaos](images/no13.png)

**Grandma story**  
Two cooks share one kitchen. One adds salt while the other removes it. The soup never stabilizes.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Shared kitchen = shared memory  
- Crossed notes = role drift  
- Salt tug-of-war = memory overwrite  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Give each cook a **named card** = **role & state keys**  
- Separate drawers for their notes = **ownership & fences**  
- Timer on who uses the stove = **tool timeout/selection gates**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Give each cook a clear card and a separate drawer.

Doctor prompt:
```

![No.14 – Bootstrap Ordering](images/no14.png)

**Grandma story**  
You try to fry eggs before turning on the stove. Of course nothing happens.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Cold pan = service not ready  
- Eggs first = calling dependencies too early  
- Burnt timing = missing warmups  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Fire on → **pan hot** → **then eggs** = **readiness probes & order**  
- Warm the oil and pan first = **cache/index warmup**  
- Check gas and matches ready = **secrets/perm checks**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Start the fire, heat the pan, then crack the eggs.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.14 Bootstrap Ordering in grandma mode and give me the smallest boot checklist

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Readiness probes pass before use  
- [ ] Warmups executed (cache/index)  
- [ ] Secrets/permissions verified

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Services fire before dependencies are ready. First calls fail, caches cold, secrets missing.

**Technical keys**
- Boot order with readiness probes  
- Cache warmup and index swaps  
- Secret checks and health gates  
- Shadow traffic before public

## No.15 Deployment Deadlock — *Grandma: You-First Doorway*
![No.15 – Deployment Deadlock](images/no15.png)

**Grandma story**  
Two people at a narrow doorway say “you first.” “No, you first.” They block the door together.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Narrow door = shared resource  
- Polite wait = mutual locks  
- Blocked door = frozen system  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Assign who goes first = **total order / priority**  
- Use a **side door** if blocked = **fallback path**  
- Set a **polite countdown** = **timeouts & backoff**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Decide who goes first, or open a side door.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.15 Deployment Deadlock in grandma mode and show the smallest unlock plan

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Priority/ordering defined  
- [ ] Fallback path available  
- [ ] Timeouts and backoff configured

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Migrator waits for writer. Writer waits for migrator. No timeout. Full stall.

**Technical keys**
- Break dependency cycle  
- Timeouts and backoff  
- Temporary read-only mode  
- Rollout gate with regression checks

## No.16 Pre-deploy Collapse — *Grandma: Burnt First Pot*
![No.16 – Pre-deploy Collapse](images/no16.png)

**Grandma story**  
First pot burns because you forgot to wash it and check the gas.

**Metaphor mapping**
- Dirty pot = stale version or index skew  
- No gas check = missing secret or permission  
- Burnt first dish = failed first call  

**Grandma fix (before-the-output) — mapping**
- Wash pot & tools first = **version pin / clean state**  
- Test the flame = **env & secrets preflight**  
- Fry a **tiny egg** as canary = **small-traffic canary**

**Minimal fix (grandma)**  
Wash the pot, test the flame, cook a tiny egg before guests arrive.

Doctor prompt:
```

please explain No.16 Pre-deploy Collapse in grandma mode and give me the smallest preflight checklist

```

**Grandma Test (30s self-check)**
- [ ] Version pinned / clean state  
- [ ] Env & secrets checked  
- [ ] Canary shipped on tiny traffic

<details>
<summary>Pro Zone</summary>

---

**Real scene**  
Version skew, missing env vars or secrets, empty vector index on first ingestion, wrong analyzer. First production call collapses.

**Technical keys**
- Preflight contract checks  
- Version pin and model lock  
- Vector index build and swap  
- Canary on minimal traffic

## What happens after you fix one

You do not patch forever. You set **acceptance targets** and keep them:

* ΔS ≤ 0.45
* Coverage ≥ 0.70
* λ state convergent
* Source present before final

When a new bug appears, map it to a number, apply the fix for that same condition, and it is typically reduced in recurrence checks. If the context drifts, consider it a re-mapping case. That is the point of a semantic firewall.

## One-line doctor prompt

If you are unsure which number fits:

```

i’ve uploaded TXT OS / WFGY notes.
which Problem Map number matches my issue?
explain using grandma mode, then give the minimal fix and the reference page.

```

## ❓ Grandma Clinic FAQ (for beginners)

**Q1. Do I need to install SDKs or special libraries?**  
No. Just copy the doctor prompt or TXT file into your LLM chat. No extra tools required.

**Q2. Will this slow down my model or cost more tokens?**  
No. WFGY is text-only. It works as a reasoning guard before output. Over time it usually saves tokens by preventing retries.

**Q3. How do I know if the fix actually worked?**  
Check the acceptance targets: ΔS ≤ 0.45, Coverage ≥ 0.70, λ convergent.  
If these hold across 3 paraphrases, the bug is usually stable for the same pattern under current targets.

**Q4. Is Grandma Clinic enough, or do I need the full Problem Map?**  
The Clinic covers the 16 most common errors in simple language.  
For deeper or vendor-specific issues, see the full [Problem Map FAQ](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/faq.md).
