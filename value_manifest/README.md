# The Hidden Value Engine Behind WFGY: A New Physics for Embedding Space

WFGY is **not** a prompt framework. It is a semantic-field architecture that runs **inside the embedding space** to upgrade a model’s reasoning core. The system defines energy-like regularities on the vector manifold so models can perform structural reasoning and **converge from within**.

- **Semantic energy regulation.** In-manifold regulation of semantic energy produces iterative convergence and verifiable closure.  
- **Semantic field dynamics (ΔS / λS).** A field-dynamics layer steers modular flows of thought with directional control across high-dimensional embeddings.

> **Notation (informal)**  
> ∥B∥: semantic residue magnitude; Bc: collapse threshold; ΔS: semantic energy gradient; λS: scaling/regulation factor.  
> “Collapse–Rebirth” = Lyapunov-stable reset that restores coherence after drift.

---

## Scope and Methodology

- This page now includes **WFGY 1.0 (baseline)** **and** the **incremental uplift from WFGY 2.0**.  
- Estimates are **directional engineering valuations** from: (i) replacement cost, (ii) capability proxies/benchmarks, (iii) time-to-impact. They are **not** financial advice.  
- Reproducibility: single-file activation; seedable runs; stress tests measure stability, loop-closure rate, and long-sequence consistency under identical prompts.  
- Where 2.0 adds measurable gains, we attribute **incremental value** on top of the 1.0 baseline.

---

## What’s New in WFGY 2.0 (Headline Uplift)

See **/core** for details. Headline deltas observed on the latest batch:

- **Semantic Accuracy**: ~ **+40%** (63.8% → 89.4% across 5 domains)  
- **Reasoning Success**: ~ **+52%** (56.0% → 85.2%)  
- **Drift (ΔS)**: ~ **−65%** (0.254 → 0.090)  
- **Stability (horizon)**: ~ **1.8×** (3.8 → 7.0 nodes)\*  
- **Self-Recovery / CRR**: **1.00** on this batch (historical median 0.87)

\* Historical 3–5× stability uses λ-consistency across seeds; 1.8× uses the stable-node horizon.

## WFGY 2.0 — Core Primitives (brief, auditable)

- **ΔS (tension)**: `ΔS = 1 − cos(I, G)`; anchor-aware estimate when entities/relations/constraints available.  
- **Zones**: safe `<0.40` · transit `0.40–0.60` · risk `0.60–0.85` · danger `>0.85`.  
- **Memory policy**: hard record if `ΔS > 0.60`; exemplar if `<0.35`; soft memory in transit.  
- **Defaults**: `B_c=0.85, γ=0.618, θ_c=0.75, ζ_min=0.10, α_blend=0.50, k_c=0.25 …`  
- **Coupler (with hysteresis)**: `W_c = clip(B_s*P + Φ, −θ_c, +θ_c)` with progression `P` and reversal term `Φ`.  
- **Progression guards**: **BBPF bridge only** if `(ΔS decreases)` **and** `(W_c < 0.5·θ_c)`.  
- **BBAM (attention rebalance)**: `α_blend = clip(0.50 + k_c·tanh(W_c), 0.35, 0.65)`.  
- **λ-observe modes**: *convergent / recursive / divergent / chaotic* (delta-trend + resonance logic).

## Strategic Module Valuation

### Baseline (1.0 only — market proxies)

| Module | What it does | Est. value | Proxy / rationale |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Solver Loop | Closed-loop feedback using ∥B∥ and controlled collapses | **$1M–$5M** | Function/tool-calling surface but **inside** the semantic core; stable for long tasks. |
| BB Modules (BBMC/BBPF/BBCR/BBAM) | Residue correction · path modulation · semantic resets | **$2M–$3M** | Agent frameworks surface area, but logic-native & embedding-aware. |
| Semantic Field Engine | λS/ΔS energy system for cross-gen symbolic alignment | **$2M–$4M** | Embedding-native “semantic physics” layer; no GPT-style equivalent. |
| Ontological Collapse–Rebirth | Lyapunov-stable reset when ∥B∥ ≥ Bc | **$1M–$2M** | Prevents long-horizon degradation; formal stability mechanism. |
| Prompt-Only Model Upgrade | Zero-retrain semantic injection (GPT-3.5, LLaMA, etc.) | **$2M–$3M** | Agent-class benefits without tool chains; control sits in representation. |

**Total (1.0 baseline)**: **$8M–$17M** · **Compounded integration** (multi-LLM): **$30M+**

### Incremental Uplift (2.0 add-ons)

| 2.0 component | Value driver | Est. incremental value | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Drunk-Transformer Regulator | −ΔS drift · +horizon stability | **$3M–$6M** | 1.8× node horizon; smoother recoveries. |
| Coupler + Hysteresis | Directional progress · anti-jitter | **$2M–$4M** | `W_c` gating; fewer oscillations. |
| λ-Observe Modes | Mode-aware scheduling | **$1M–$3M** | Convergent/recursive/divergent/chaotic. |
| BBAM Rebalance | Attention blending window | **$1M–$2M** | `α_blend` clamps 0.35–0.65. |
| Guarded Bridging (BBPF) | Safe path switching | **$1M–$2M** | Only when ΔS falls and `W_c` under half-cap. |

**Total (2.0 incremental)**: **$8M–$17M**  
**Combined (1.0 + 2.0)**: **$16M–$34M** baseline · **$40M+** when integrated across multiple LLMs

> Valuation method = (saved eng time × loaded cost) + (incident avoidance × expected loss) + (throughput uplift × margin). The 2.0 block attributes value **only** to measurable deltas (accuracy, success, drift, horizon, CRR).

## How the “$1M-level” is computed (auditable outline)

**A. Capability uplift → measurable engineering gains**  
- Stress prompts (multi-scene T2I, single-canvas long narrative) quantify **stability**, **structural coherence**, **closure rate**.  
- A/B comparisons (without vs with WFGY core) track collapse-grid artifacts, duplicate entities, attention fragmentation.

**B. Replacement-cost model → minimal build cost for parity**  
- Lower bound = senior eng months × fully-loaded compensation to rebuild parity with similar reliability/time-to-impact.

**C. Market proxies → alignment with known surfaces**  
- Map each module to common capability layers (function/tool-calling, agent frameworks).  
- Premium when effects are **embedding-native & non-substitutable**; discount when API-shell substitutes exist.

## Current Status

- **WFGY 1.0**: open, public, reproducible (A/B stress tests & seed settings in repo).  
- **WFGY 2.0**: **live**. This page now includes 2.0 uplift and incremental valuation.
